Detects AdBlocking software and allows to display some html based on detection result. Word for AdBlock for sure. Should work for others.

== Description ==

The plugin is very simple and it doesn't come with any changable options.

The only feature it has is ability to detect the AdBlock (tested on Chrome AdBlock extension) and defines the HTML class allowing to control the visibility of
the elements on your page based on the detection result eg. you can show an element on your page only if AdBlock is detected, or hide it.
